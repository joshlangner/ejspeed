=======

A modification of EmbeddedJS (http://embeddedjs.com/). Features:

* 10x faster - much more comparable with popular templating engines
* Has working "partial" support via a `<%= include('file.html') %>` method
* Code cleaned up

How to use: Coming soon. See http://embeddedjs.com/ for now.

Basic include support works as follows:

`<%= include('subfolder/partial.html') %>`
